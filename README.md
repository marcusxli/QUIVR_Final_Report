# Comprehensive Analysis Report: Qualitative Visualization in Research

## Abstract

We replicated Verdinelli and Scagnoli (2013) by coding 20 articles containing 33 visualizations from three qualitative journals (2020-2022). Interclass correlation revealed striking variation: high agreement on counting figures (ICC = 0.963), moderate agreement on epistemology type (ICC = 0.633), but poor agreement on analytical purpose (ICC = 0.186). Matrix and descriptive categories achieved only 65% agreement. Despite these reliability challenges, Epistemic Network Analysis revealed consistent patterns, as matrix displays dominated constructivist research for interpretive purposes, objectivist studies used matrices exploratorily, and subjectivist work employed photographs descriptively. Our findings reveal a paradox: qualitative visualizations exhibit reproducible patterns, yet current rubrics lack operational clarity for reliable coding. We recommend allowing multiple epistemological stances per paper, explicitly including tables as visualization types, and developing clearer operational definitions for analytical purposes to strengthen systematic analysis and enable rigorous cross-study comparison.

## 1. Introduction {#introduction}

This report presents a comprehensive replication and extension of Verdinelli and Scagnoli's (2013) framework for analyzing qualitative research visualizations. We examined how epistemological perspectives relate to visualization choices and analytical purposes in contemporary qualitative research publications.
